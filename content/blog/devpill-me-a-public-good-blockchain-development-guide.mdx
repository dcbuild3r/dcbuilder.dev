## NFT edition

I'm trying to gather resources to fund the development of this public good blockchain development guide and so I got my fren Ana Rueda ([@ruedart](https://twitter.com/ruedart)) to create this amazing graphic for the Mirror NFT edition linked above. The funds will go to the continued development of this guide (90%) and to Ana for the creation of the art (10%). I'm open to discussion on how to structure the open collaboration around the guide and to allocating the funds into a community-owned multi-sig. The goal is to use the funds gathered on Mirror, Gitcoin grants round 13 and elsewhere to incentivize developers to create sections through bounty submissions. If this idea doesn't gather appeal, then I will send the funds to the Gitcoin grants matching round so that other public goods get funded.

## Description

Nowadays there are countless well-made resources on how to learn blockchain development of all kinds and with different specializations in mind, however, it is still very hard to get guidance and personalized suggestions based on your interests. I am writing this guide in order to provide an aggregator of all the resources that I've found over the years, plus give some opinionated commentary on how to approach them and how to use them in order to maximize learning and practical understanding in order to get building cool things in the space as soon as possible.

This guide focuses on the Ethereum ecosystem as that's where most developers and applications are. If you are interested in other ecosystems that are non-EVM compatible and are not L2s on Ethereum, then check out their respective documentation or guides written by their developer communities. Examples of other non-EVM compatible blockchains that are popular are Solana (Rust/Anchor), Polkadot (Rust/Substrate), Cosmos, Terra, and others. Most of these blockchains do or will support the EVM stack through various initiatives like Neon EVM (Solana), Moonbeam/Moonriver (Polkadot/Kusama), EVMOS (Cosmos), etc.

I really want this guide to become a community-sourced public good that everyone will be able to take advantage of. I will do my best to present it to the wider blockchain developer community to get constructive feedback, proofreading help, and insight into how to make it the best available guide available.

Check out the initial version of the guide at [devpill.me](http://devpill.me/). So far it is a GitHub README file, however, the long-term goal is to create a custom UI for the guides as new content gets pushed to the repo and people start curating their own specializations and sections.

## Structure

The guide is separated into various different sections categorized by the skillset a developer requires to build a specific application or by the field that application falls in (i.e. DeFi, creator economy, etc). There are also sections on how to get started with web3 development, will also include a section on soft skills for developers, how to get a job in the space, how to grow a social following and leverage it to build better software, and more! If you have any suggestions on other sections or structural changes, feel free to [submit a PR to the repo](https://github.com/dcbuild3r/blockchain-development-guide).

## Notes

This guide is far from a finished product, I wanted to launch at least something which has enough substance to be useful, but it is very much a work in process in all aspects. I want to build it out in the open and get more input and contributions from the community in order to make the best possible resource out there.

## Special Thanks

I want to thank all present and future contributors to the guide and creators of the resources that we reference inside of it, without your tutorials, insights, and support this wouldn't be possible. I'd also like to thank [Kevin Owocki](https://twitter.com/owocki) for inspiring me to create this resource as a public good through his work at [Green Pill](https://greenpill.party/) (thanks for the name inspiration as well, hope it isn't too obvious) and [Gitcoin](https://gitcoin.co/). I'm very grateful for the beautiful drawing that [Ana Rueda](https://twitter.com/ruedart) made for the NFT, I sincerely supporters of the guide enjoy it.
