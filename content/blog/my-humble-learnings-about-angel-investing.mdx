This article does not contain financial or legal advice; it is just my personal experience as part of my desire to help and educate others. It is entirely separate from my current work at the Worldcoin Foundation or my previous work at Tools For Humanity.

## TL;DR

- Angel investing is a great way to gain exposure to an industry in which you possess asymmetric knowledge or domain expertise.
- Advising projects for equity or becoming an investor because you are knowledgeable about the startup's technology, product, or industry is what I've found to be most lucrative and enjoyable.
- You are investing in people; remember that.
- Build relationships, build trust, and do things in earnest; your reputation is everything: how you make people feel and your actions to help them go a long way.
- Capital is abundant. Morality, integrity, intelligence, honesty, experience, wisdom, social capital, capacity to execute, and domain expertise are scarce.
- Look for projects that build positive sum products or services.
- Do everything the right way, don't cut corners, have a proper structure (accountant, lawyer,...), and never burn bridges.
- I'm extremely illiquid for the next few years, this is not for people who cannot afford to lose the money they put in, everything is a bet

## Introduction

I have been looking to write this article for a long while but never really got around to doing it justice. I'll probably have to write a follow-up to this article at some point, but I believe this is a good starting point.

In late 2021, I wrote [The Ultimate Guide to L2s on Ethereum](https://dcbuilder.mirror.xyz/QX_ELJBQBm1Iq45ktPsz8pWLZN1C52DmEtH09boZuo0), in which I explained how rollups work, my predictions for what Ethereum L2 and L1 scalability would look like, and the projects that were building said future. After writing it, publishing it, and posting about it on Twitter, I received a DM from L2Beat asking if I wanted to angel invest in their project since I was one of the most active community members in the L2 discussion space. At that time, I was just a 20-year-old who had made some money from airdrops and farming different protocols throughout DeFi summer. I had some money saved but didn't know what to do with it. I was willing to give it a try. What is the worst thing that could go wrong? It was a big turning point for me, now that I am reflecting on how that directionally impacted my life. It gave me an outside confirmation that something like angel investing was more accessible than I thought, as someone very young and inexperienced in investing.

Since then, I have angeled in about 35 projects, and I still have some deal flow to go through that I will reveal once everything is closed and publicly announced. It has genuinely helped me a lot when it comes to having access to brilliant people working on the tip of the spear of each of their respective fields, and that is by far the most valuable thing that I have gotten out of angel investing.

One of the original motivations for writing this article is that, as a builder, you tend to overlook investing because you are already too busy with everything you need to do. However, engineers and builders have an edge over the market in terms of understanding many things. This is especially true in crypto, where many advantages are nuanced, subtle, and technical. A technical understanding of the space will give you a lot of edge in investing as an angel.

## Early steps

It all starts with some form of luck, but luck is the byproduct of a lot of work. I spend lots of time on X/Twitter, and I have some visibility thanks to some of the articles and posts I have shared in the past. Visibility in the space around specific topics will make you part of the collective mindshare of the space. When I started angel investing, I didn't do any reachouts. It happened organically because the friends I met along the way at conferences happened to fundraise after I met them somewhere down the line.

Building a personal relationship with teams at conferences, deeply caring about what they are trying to develop, and being helpful wherever possible are the best ways to do it. Going to events and building relationships with many teams and individuals greatly increased my social capital over a relatively short time. One key thing to notice is that social capital compounds just as much as your financial capital, if not more, and I believe that social capital is the biggest driver in professional success in any endeavor.

The first few deals are a big learning experience, you have to figure out how you're going to do taxes, accounting, what is a signature block, how company valuations work, what pre-seed/seed/series A/B/... rounds mean, you start thinking about a framework for how you decide which companies to invest in and for what reason, you start forming your own opinions on the private market and different founders, you build relationships, history, you start advising some of them and try to help them succeed.

As a builder, I was coding all day, but thanks to that, I also started understanding the different tech stacks of all the projects in the space. Being technical is a blessing, if you learn cryptography, for example, you can start reasoning about ZK/FHE/MPC startups, digital identity, blockchains, and so many other things.

## Later stages

Now, after doing 35 angel deals or so and having about 11 more to fulfill in the next month or two, I think about how to provide value to my portfolio companies to help them succeed. One of the most exciting ways I like to work with my portfolio companies is to help them be synergistic, introduce the founders to each other, and help build synergies at scale.

One thing that has helped me substantially is to network a lot with fellow angels and venture capital firms. Helping portcos from your favorite investors in various different ways and sharing dealflow with one another is a very positive sum.

## Portfolio Thesis

From my portfolio, you can see what narratives I'm excited about:

**Scalability** - At Worldcoin, I have seen true scale, and I see the issues we face all the time due to lack of blockspace, slow block times, slow throughput, state bottlenecks, proving costs, and more.

**AI x Crypto** - Before I was into crypto, I interned at an AI startup doing computer vision. The reason why I chose to specialize in crypto as opposed to AI is because the ideals and culture of crypto match my own much better. What if we could disrupt the status quo of AI and leverage crypto rails and tech to help it become more cypherpunk?

**Digital Identity** - Throughout my work, I've written extensively about [The Future of Digital Identity](https://dcbuilder.mirror.xyz/myIlus8pl6SbyuUR4ufGf9OYRps8hCGqeZHNYce3i94). Digital identity is going to enable many new use cases in 2025 and beyond.

## Operational Tips

One of the most non-straightforward things about angel investing, especially if you do it often, is the communications and administrative overhead it creates. To manage communications, I use a system of tags and reminders on Telegram. I recommend tracking all of your deals using a combination of notetaking applications (I use Notion and Obsidian) / spreadsheet program and a portfolio tracker (I personally use [Rotki Premium](https://rotki.com/products)).

This information will help you immensely with accounting tax obligations when time goes around to selling and to just have peace of mind that you know that you are on top of things and that you're not letting any opportunities slip through the cracks.

I also wanted to shed some light on how I think about capital allocation. Since I'm very young and I purposefully live well below my means, I am able to save most of my monthly earnings. I used to mostly hold LST ETH and a few tokens I liked, but ever since I started angel investing, I have liquidated all of my liquid assets into stablecoins, started saving up my income every month, and put it all into angel investments over time.

## Closing thoughts

I hope this article has helped you in some way. Angel investing, to me, is an important way to build relationships with people I admire, enjoy spending time with, and would like to work with because I believe in their missions, values, and products, as well as in their ability to pull it off. It is a great way to share ownership over the technologies that we are building and to asymmetrically benefit when you know where the wind is blowing.

I will keep updating my portfolio companies on [my website](http://dcbuilder.dev/) with a short blurb on why I like them and what they are doing.

I hope to catch up with you all at ETHCC in Brussels, SBC, Zuzalu, or Devcon in Thailand later this year, friends.
