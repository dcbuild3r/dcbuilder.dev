gm. It's been a while. I missed you. Writing about different topics I'm interested in and doing research to solidify my understanding of different concepts and ideas is something I enjoyed a lot when I first joined the space in 2018. However, in the last year and a half, it has been harder to find the time to write articles.

In this article, I will try to present a holistic overview of what the space of digital identity has to offer at the moment and what my ideal future would look like as the underlying technologies evolve and gain mass adoption. In the last couple of years, many new cryptographic primitives have emerged from different fields like zero-knowledge (ZK), fully-homomorphic encryption (FHE), trusted-execution environments (TEEs), and multi-party computation (MPC). Many of these primitives are very useful in the context of making attestations about data, proving provenance and data integrity, and proving composable statements to third parties, which are core building blocks of any identity protocol. The way that identity protocols have worked until now is with trusted third parties that issue certificates or sign messages from a root public key which is in some certificate authority (CA) registry, these signatures can then be verified and applications can leverage the underlying attestations in meaningful ways. New approaches allow users to self-custody their data and selectively make attestations about their private information without revealing more than they want to / need to, these new attestations are composable, and unlock access to many possibilities that were impossible in the past.

## TL;DR

## Identity landscape

It is almost 2024, and we are living in a world where we have advanced AIs, sophisticated blockchain protocols, and reusable space rockets, but somehow we still use a piece of paper to prove who we are to other people and all of our data is owned by big corporations that profit off of everything we do. In this section, I briefly introduce the identity primitives we currently use and the properties they have.

### Government credentials

Most of the world is used to having a set of physical/digital legal documents that represent who they are within the country they are citizens of. We are used to showing these documents to third parties whenever they want to verify a given fact about us (age, nationality,...) and some databases associate the uniquely identifying string representing each document with other useful data like earnings (accounting), tax records, criminal records, legal records, etc. This puts a lot of trust in the issuers of these government credentials, as they are the sole providers of these attestations. These credentials are also not interoperable with other systems and are very hard to work with. Most countries don't have an easy way to extract your personal information or information associated with you into the digital realm. All of these attestations usually live in the physical world, are very privacy-invasive, and don't scale at all.

There are however some countries that have functioning digital ID systems that are provided by their respective government authorities. Some of them are very privacy-invasive and act as tools of population control, some others are built with a focus on privacy, and solutions fall everywhere in between this spectrum.

Examples:

- [e-Identity](https://e-estonia.com/solutions/e-identity/id-card/) (Estonia)
- [AADHAAR](https://www.uidai.gov.in/en/16-english-uk/aapka-aadhaar/14-what-is-aadhaar.html) (India)
- [Resident Identity Card](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resident_Identity_Card) (China)

### SSO credentials

As most people have gotten access to the internet, many have generated accounts in different applications and platforms and used these accounts as login credentials within other service providers and applications. In this world, applications store different cookies and signatures over different parts of our activities on these platforms to communicate things like our preferences, usage metrics, interests, and more. This is another form of identity that we use to get better services (better content/product recommendations, tailored experiences,...) or to access services that use our data to be able to provide these products to us for free in exchange for selling our data to advertisers on their platforms.

Government and SSO credentials are usually used as indices for all the other data that is stored by the digital services and products we use. These applications store some information about our usage, and preferences, and tie it back to either our login or government-issued credentials. All of the data and value we create which is part of our identity is custodied by the platforms and services we use, the data usually can't be exported (unless [GDPR](https://gdpr-info.eu/) requires it), it is not interoperable with other services, and platforms and users are at the mercy of the platform. In case things go south users' accounts can be terminated without notice which can oftentimes end the livelihood of users in the case of platforms like YouTube, Twitch, X, and others. The data and content we create are thus siloed, and there are no signs of this ever-changing. We must opt out of this system if we value our freedom and sovereignty.

### Status quo

As we can see, government digital IDs, SSO credentials, and platform databases as they are used currently put users' data in the hands of third parties that then sell this very valuable data to advertisers and other third parties to generate revenue and profit, which in turn jeopardizes users' privacy and freedom.

There are many problems with the way that we do digital identity nowadays. Centralized data custodians are security and privacy liabilities that are subject to mass leakage and exploits which lead to phishing, sabotage, privacy violations, and more. They are also not very scalable, government IDs have a different format in each country and are only distributed to a very limited amount of the world population, it is estimated that about half of the world does not have access to any form of digital identity with up to 850 million not having access to any form of government identity.

The current forms of identification are also not interoperable, you cannot build applications that leverage information from your personal documents, internet history, product usage, and other sources easily. Digital identity is also not standardized and there is no easy way to verify the provenance of the information you want to leverage.

Properties of current identity systems:

- Opaque
- Siloed data (non-exportable)
- Centralized
- Non-interoperable
- Hard to build applications with their data
- Privacy invasive
- Users don't have agency over their data (lack of sovereignty)

For those of you who don't keep up with the latest and greatest in the field of academic cryptography (don't worry, I don't refresh IACR's eprint daily either), there has been an accelerating pace of advances.

In particular, there's increasing practicality in many powerful primitives whose properties may completely revolutionize the world of digital identity. I will do my best to introduce some of them in this post and refer the curious to further resources. Not only have these primitives just emerged, but they have also started reaching a level of maturity and adoption that makes it feasible for startups, researchers, and engineers to build new products and proofs of concepts around them in a production-ready way.

ZK has been one of the most relevant technologies within the crypto industry as many projects working on Ethereum's L2 scalability roadmap and different privacy solutions have gone into production over the last two years. You can think of ZK as allowing you to prove certain statements or computations over some initial data without revealing anything else besides the statement. The main properties of ZK are:

- Succinctness: It is a lot easier to verify a ZK proof of a computation than to perform the computation yourself.
- Completeness: If a given statement is true, an honest verifier will be convinced by an honest prover.
- Soundness: If the statement is false, no deceptive prover can convince an honest verifier that it is true, except with some negligible probability.
- Computational integrity: With ZK you can prove that any computation over any input data was performed correctly.
- Zero-Knowledge: The verifier learns nothing other than the fact that the statement is true.

In the context of digital identity, zero-knowledge proofs are extremely useful as they allow us to make provable statements about some data that anyone can verify, whilst keeping things we don't want to disclose private. Self-sovereign selective disclosure is going to be one of the main pillars of the use cases we will look into in the following sections.

The biggest trust assumption you are making when it comes to ZK is the provenance of the data that you are making ZK proofs of. In rollups everyone can download all of the state of a zk rollup from Ethereum calldata and verify the proof of every state transition in the system, in an arbitrary digital identity system this data is often not public and so there is a root authority that you need to trust for sourcing the data, similar to how web2 works today, however with much better computational correctness and privacy guarantees.

Fully homomorphic encryption as opposed to regular encryption schemes that you may be familiar with in traditional web2 systems or even web3 has one main distinction. It allows you to do computations over ciphertext and when you decrypt said ciphertext using a key, the computation will persist over the original input into the encryption scheme. In regular encryption, you get a pseudorandom string of bytes representing the ciphertext, however, you can't do anything with that ciphertext besides decrypting it. Fully homomorphic encryption allows us to do fully private computation over any FHE-encrypted data.

Properties of FHE:

- Data privacy: As opposed to ZK, FHE provides true data privacy, not just computational privacy.
- Quantum-resistant
- Slowness: FHE and its variants incur a big computational overhead compared to just running the computations over the original data.

For digital identity, FHE might be useful to do operations over sensitive data in a way where the operator does not learn what data they are computing over. Private APIs serving results over some signed input by some public key that they trust will be a strong primitive for many protocols that do not require proofs of computation.

SMPC enables multiple parties to jointly compute a function using private data, keeping individual inputs confidential while still producing the correct output. It uses encryption and secret sharing to ensure privacy and security during the computation process.

Properties:

- Data privacy: Users can keep their data confidential while allowing third parties to use it in their applications, research, voting mechanisms, and more.
- Collaborative (distributed): can securely aggregate and analyze data from multiple sources without compromising privacy
- Quantum-safe: Current SMPC schemes are resistant to quantum computers

In the digital identity space, SMPC could allow for distributed computation of ZK proofs of different attestations in a way where the parties computing the proof, in the end, don't learn what the individual inputs were since SMPC schemes have input data privacy, this field is called "Collaborative zkSNARKs".

A TEE can be thought of as a separate environment within a computer that is protected from other components using encryption and custom hardware. TEEs can functionally replace ZK, FHE, and MPC, however, they come with their own set of trade-offs. You can think of TEEs as trusted third parties that are capable of arbitrary, inexpensive computations with the ability to make attestations about the computations they are making, whilst keeping those computations private.

Properties:

- tamper-proof execution environment
- attestations: data provenance is one of the most important use cases of TEEs
- private computation: the data and computations cannot be extracted outside of the TEE
- can function like ZK, MPC, FHE
- performant: minimal computational overhead compared to ZK, MPC, FHE

One major area where TEEs are relevant is in the creation of attested sensors, pieces of hardware that act as oracles for the real world and create data out of it. Attested sensors like attested cameras, microphones, keyboards, the Worldcoin orb, and many others, these attested sensors provide signatures that come from the secure enclave of the devices which stores a key that cannot be extracted.

Downsides:

- Trust in hardware and firmware security
- Trust in a third party operating these devices in good faith

Over the last couple of years, a plethora of new building blocks have greatly expanded the design space of protocols that can be used within the digital identity domain by leveraging many of the cryptographic primitives introduced earlier. Many of them enable new types of computation over an ever-increasing amount of data in a way that is privacy-preserving and users retain sovereignty and custody of their data. We are only at the very beginning, many of these protocols emerged recently and people are starting to explore the extent of what can be built with them.

### ZK Email

[ZK Email](https://prove.email/) is probably my favorite protocol that has come out recently. It allows anyone to create a ZK proof that an email sent by someone with some specific title has some information within it. You can make attestations about the provenance of the email (which domain and user it was sent from) as well as the content it contains. With this primitive, we can bridge existing web2 infrastructure and data onto web3 thanks to programmable provenance which is powerful.

### zkLogin

zkLogin is a Sui primitive that provides the ability for you to send transactions from a Sui address using an OAuth credential, without publicly linking the two. It allows a user to sign any arbitrary transaction on Sui by authenticating with a traditional OID provider like Facebook/Instagram, Google, Twitch, and others.

### TLSNotary

[TLSNotary](https://tlsnotary.org/) is a protocol that allows for the creation of proofs of data provenance for any data on the web as long as it lives on a website using the TLS protocol. This is another major unlock in the amount of Web2 data that we can now make proofs and attestations about and will enable new forms of digital identity.

### Proof of Personhood

I think it comes as no surprise that I will talk about the importance of proof of personhood and Sybil resistance as it has been my main focus for the last year and a half as part of my work at Tools for Humanity (the main developers of Worldcoin).

I deeply believe that being able to prove that you are a human online is going to be one of the biggest unlocks of potential for building fair, credibly neutral, DoS-resistant, and scalable mechanisms, protocols, and applications. Whether it is anonymous private voting where each person can only vote once, fair distribution mechanisms (airdrops, raffles, giveaways, royalties, UBI, ticketing,...), Sybil-resistant APIs and applications (better captcha, anonymous SSOs, on-chain actions), and many more things. [World ID](https://worldcoin.org/world-id) is the protocol that enables this by allowing users to create a ZK proof of inclusion into the set of verified users and that a given nullifier hash for an action has not been "consumed" before.

To anyone curious and want to learn more, I recommend reading [the Worldcoin whitepaper](https://whitepaper.worldcoin.org/) which goes in-depth on every single aspect of the project, from the hardware to biometrics, cryptography, blockchain, and more.

### RLN

[RLN](https://rate-limiting-nullifier.github.io/rln-docs/rln.html) is a zk-gadget/protocol that enables a spam prevention mechanism for anonymous environments. In truly anonymous systems, where users don't share any information about themselves to prove uniqueness, there are not many ways to prevent Sybil attacks and spam. RLN is a method in which a user registers using a private key and puts up a small stake in the network by leveraging ZK nullifiers that allow a given user to only perform certain actions a certain amount of time.

### MACI

[MACI](https://maci.pse.dev/) is a protocol originally proposed by Vitalik and implemented by PSE that provides a private, on-chain voting system. It enables organizations to conduct on-chain voting processes with a significantly reduced risk of cheating, such as bribery or collusion.

### Attestations

An attestation is a declaration or statement made to confirm the authenticity, accuracy, or truthfulness of something. In the context of applied cryptography and distributed systems, attestations often refer to cryptographic proofs or certificates that verify the integrity or attributes of data, software, or hardware components.

There are many projects already working in this space:

- [Clique](https://clique.social/)
- [EAS](https://attest.sh/)
- [Intuition](https://intuition.systems/)
- [Polygon ID](https://polygonid.com/)
- [ZuPass](https://github.com/proofcarryingdata/zupass)
- [Sismo](https://www.sismo.io/)

### Web of Trust

Web of trust is a concept that originally comes from the world of cryptography where different entities share public keys and the identity attached to them among themselves in a peer-to-peer fashion and sign each others' keys to build public trust. This concept can be expanded beyond Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and into the general world of attestations.

Through the use of web of trust networks and attestations, we can build notions of reputation, credit scoring, accountability, merit, and more.

### ZK KYC

KYC is always going to a primitive and will be used by services that require government-issued identification, however, sometimes we may want to share our age, nationality, or any other detail from personal documents without revealing everything else. This is something that ZK KYC can be used for, as long as the public key of the signing entity (government) is known, we can prove that we have a signature over some personal data that came from it, and in the zero-knowledge proofs, we can make proofs about different parts of the documents.

### ZK Co-Processors

ZK co-processors are essentially separate computational environments to which you send some data, they can perform arbitrary operations on that data, they produce a ZK proof of all of the computations that they did, and then they send back the proof to the sender.

Some projects working on this problem space:

- [Axiom](https://www.axiom.xyz/)
- [Risc-Zero](https://www.risczero.com/)

### Storage proofs

In blockchain systems today, each node on the network synchronizes the latest state every single time a new block is inserted. With storage proofs, you can prove using SNARKS/STARKS ("ZK") the inclusion of any data within a given blockchain.

Projects tackling storage proofs:

- [Axiom](https://www.axiom.xyz/)
- [Herodotus](https://herodotus.dev/)
- [Lagrange](https://www.lagrange.dev/)

### Proof aggregators

With all of the attestations we create, there will be a gigantic demand for the creation of zero-knowledge proofs and this will drastically increase the computational load on the public blockchains we use to verify them. Proof aggregators are a way of cryptographically batching the operation of verifying individual proof into the operation of verifying one aggregate proof of all its constituents.

Projects tackling proof aggregation:

- [Nebra](https://www.nebra.one/)

### Intents

Intents are the set of end goals that a user has. Instead of the user performing each step on their own, they sign a message that allows a third party ("solver") to execute that action once conditions are met. It turns an imperative paradigm to a declarative paradigm.

For more resources on intents, check out:

- [Intent-Based Architectures and Their Risks](https://www.paradigm.xyz/2023/06/intents)

### Proof marketplaces

Proof marketplaces, as the name implies, are places where people (or bots) buy and sell proofs. There is going to be strong demand to generate proofs of different kinds: proof of solvency, proof of optimum risk-adjusted yield, proof of good financial history, proof of social status, and more.

There are already some projects exploring these ideas:

- [Nil Foundation](https://nil.foundation/)
- [Succinct](https://succinct.xyz/)
- Gevulot

### Oracles

Oracles are external data providers to smart contracts and dApps. In the context of digital identity oracles can be used to fetch external data (for prediction markets, attestations, and more).

Some popular oracle projects:

- [Chainlink](https://chain.link/)
- [Chronicle](https://chroniclelabs.org/)
- [Pyth](https://pyth.network/)

### Prediction markets

Prediction markets allow users to bet on the results of future events by buying into tokens that represent the different outcomes. I believe that prediction markets will play a key role in the world of digital identity, especially in the context of reputation.

Projects building prediction markets:

- [Manifold](https://manifold.markets/)
- [Polymarket](https://polymarket.com/)
- [Kalshi](https://kalshi.com/)
- [Augur](https://augur.net/)

### ZKML

Zero-knowledge machine learning is the act of creating ZK proofs of the inference step of machine learning algorithms. For a more in-depth explanation, I gave a [talk on ZKML](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4X841gDnwY&t=105s) at ETHCC.

Projects working on ZKML:

- [Modulus](https://www.modulus.xyz/)
- [Giza](https://gizatech.xyz/)
- [Ezkl](https://ezkl.xyz/)

## The Future

I hope that I have convinced you that the current status quo of digital identity is something we don't want for humanity for the years to come and that in recent years there have been a lot of advances in technologies that can drastically improve the digital identity system design space of what could be built.

There will be a day when everyone runs a light client for all the different major blockchains, data availability networks, and scaling solutions, they will be able to generate storage proofs of any on-chain and off-chain data, and they can create proofs about statements/attestations over that data and the data on their phone storage/cloud (using TEEs), aggregate those proofs and permissionlessly submit them to the chain via the light client or to an API of any kind.

### The pipeline

How does the entire stack look from a bird's eye view?

It all starts with data, data rules the world, it is what encodes all of our interactions, preferences, and information. Every individual has the right to own their data, it is one of our most valuable assets.

Luckily cryptography allows us to verify where some data might be coming from and who might be sending it. For every medium there is a way to get data and a way to verify and certify its provenance in an external environment.

The second major component in our digital identity pipeline is attestations and provable off-chain compute (ZK co-processors). Once we have the source data and proof of where it came from we can start processing the data to be able to extract insights from it and make provable statements about the data.

Once we have all our data, our data provenance proofs, and attestations we can start aggregating them into composite statements that start to mean something to the end consumer.

Intent-driven designs are becoming increasingly popular nowadays to simplify the user experience of most applications we use. Specialized participants will find what data sources and proving techniques to use as well as how to aggregate them efficiently.

We can now prove the entire digital identity lifecycle, from source data to the end consumer of attestations. All while preserving user sovereignty, privacy, integrity, composability, and decentralization.

So to summarize the digital identity pipeline I foresee is composed of:

- Data sources and data provenance proofs
- Attestations and off-chain provable compute
- Proof aggregators and proof marketplaces
- intent-driven interface and solvers
- provable inference (ZKML)

### Standardization

The digital identity space has been around and many different organizations have tried to create standards that allow interoperability across platforms. Standards are **incredibly hard to do well**. One of my biggest wishes for the industry is to have more cross-team communications, discuss such standards, and achieve consensus on them.

At the very beginning, we examined what are the properties of existing identity protocols and how they could transform:

- Opaque -> Open and permissionless
- Siloed data (non-exportable) -> Composable data and attestations
- Centralized -> Decentralized and owned by everyone
- Non-interoperable -> Interoperable with any open system
- Hard to build applications with their data -> open SDKs, infrastructure, and tooling
- Privacy invasive -> Privacy-preserving
- Users don't have agency over their data -> Self-sovereign, self-custody

That was a lot of information I just shared, there is a lot to go through, but I believe that all of these ingredients will be instrumental in the creation of a future where we embrace the values of decentralization, individual and group sovereignty, openness, privacy, inclusivity and shared ownership.

If we manage to create humankind-wide decentralized systems we will be able to coordinate at scales never seen before which is one of the most important parts of solving the systemic coordination failures we are facing today.

## Closing words

It was really fun writing this article, I really missed doing this. I hope you had as much fun reading it as I did writing it. Some of the articles that I am looking to write soon are my yearly summary and goals for next year, and an article talking about all the angel investments that I have done over the last two years and why I believe in the teams I have invested in.

At the very end, I want to post some open problems that we are working on at Worldcoin that are related to the material I talk about.
