## Assignment Priority

When a job title could match multiple departments, use this priority:

1. **Primary Function First** - What will this person do day-to-day?
2. **Seniority Doesn't Change Department** - "Senior Engineer" is still Engineering
3. **Hybrid Roles** - Use the more specific department
   - "Product Designer" → Design (not Product)
   - "Growth Engineer" → Engineering (not Marketing)
   - "Sales Engineer" → Sales (not Engineering)
   - "DevRel Engineer" → Developer Relations
